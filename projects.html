          <h3>Electric Vehicle Energy Demand Prediction Techniques Using Machine Learning</h3>
          <p>This project involves predicting the energy demand of electric vehicles (EVs) using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data, such as EV usage patterns, weather conditions, battery status, and route information, machine learning models are trained to forecast the energy consumption of EVs over time.</p>

          <h3>Machine Learning And Deep Learning Approaches For CyberSecurity:A Review</h3>
          <p>This review explores the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in enhancing cybersecurity. With the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, traditional security methods are often insufficient. ML and DL offer advanced solutions for detecting, preventing, and mitigating cyber threats by automatically learning patterns and anomalies from vast amounts of security data.</p>
